# -112-Operator-modifier-of-the-staff-ability-value
This is a modifier I wrote in C to change the staff ability value in the game. 

No GUI because I'm lazy.

Description:

0. This code can be used to change the driving, shooting accuracy, first aid, and technical work attribute values of all personnel in the archive (in team, standby, shop). For Windows systems only. 
1. Compile the exe. Run the program and enter the file name and minimum attribute value as prompted. Or directly drag the file you want to change onto the exe. 
2. The default save file is C:\Users\{your username}\AppData\LocalLow\JutsuGames\112 Operator\Saves\{any name}.json (without .info)
3. All rights reserved...
4. Because of the strange read and write permissions of the folder where the archive is located, it is strongly recommended that you copy the archive file and paste it back after the modification is completed.
